How does it work? Well, it's a browser (Chrome) plugin, that chekcs albums on the page and then injects spotify link if there is any. <br>

At the moment "works" with:

<ul>
	<li>Recordstores: Boomkat, Juno, Mimaroglu, Aquarius</li>
	<li>Webzines: Tinymixtapes, The Quietus, Drowned In Sound</li>
	<li>Databases: Discogs, Metacritic, Metal Archives, Rate Your Music</li>
</ul>
